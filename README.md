# Mouse_Cursor_movemnet_Uisng_Eyes
Its My Final year project.
This project focuses on providing the overview about the various eye based cursor movement techniques developed & proposed. Hence we conclude for developing low-cost based system aims to handle & also affordable for the majority of the physically challenge subjects. Thus this project shows how we can access our computer machine with respect to human iris.
* PROPOSED SYSTEM 
The basic actions of the mouse are mouse click and mouse movement. Modern 
technology with the help of Open CV changes the movement of this mouse by changing the 
movement of the eyes. Mouse button clicks are applied to any number of facial expressions, 
such as blinking, opening the mouth, and nodding. 
Due to the standard configuration in personal computers (PCs), it rapidly interacts with human
machines via visual face tracking and provides a viable solution for hands-free control. 
This new look is based on 3D analysis of the human eye. There are various commercial 
products that make use of the tweaking technology. In this method, the user has to show only 
one point for calibration, then he will estimate the point by looking at it. Facial features such 
as eyes and nose are identified and tracked to prevent traditional mouse movement along the 
human face for human interaction with the computer. This method can be applied to a wide 
range of facial scales
